We'll be meeting in POETS in CPH at 7:00PM on Friday, February 27th to watch 
the Mystery Science Theatre version of Space Mutiny with the [Women in Computer
Science Undergraduate Committee](http://wics.uwaterloo.ca)! Get ready to grab
some popcorn for "the movie that was going to overtake Star Wars"!

After the movie, we'll be trying out some new handheld equipment in POETS or in 
our office.

Everyone is welcome to join! Keep in mind that all our events are governed by 
our [Code of Conduct]({{site.url}}/policies-procedures/code-of-conduct/).
